# External Enrichment Guidelines

When supplementing DirectEd's knowledge base with external resources, ensure:

- The material is **relevant** to DirectEd's technology curriculum (Foundations, Fullstack, GenAI, UI/UX).
- Sources are **credible** (e.g., official documentation, textbooks, research papers, reputable tutorials).
- Content is **aligned** with DirectEd's educational standards and learning objectives.
- All external additions must be **reviewed and agreed on as a team** before inclusion.

Examples of useful sources:
- MDN Web Docs (for Web/JS content)
- MongoDB official documentation
- FastAPI documentation
- Research papers and technical blogs on Generative AI
