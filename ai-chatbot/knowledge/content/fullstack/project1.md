# Web Dev Phase

## üéØ **Goals**

Take the Figma design of the Social Blogging App and bring it to life with clean, reusable code. Build a responsive, accessible frontend using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, and connect it to a secure backend powered by **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. Ensure all features work seamlessly, including authentication, blog and comment management, and integration with the AI chatbot API, to deliver a polished, deployment-ready application.

This is not a template or a mock-up; this is a real, coded product. Build like someone might use it tomorrow.

## üéí **Learning Goals**

By completing this project, you will:

- Strengthen your skills in **React.js** by building reusable components and managing application state with props and hooks.
- Apply **Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS)** to create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces.
- Develop RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling CRUD operations for blogs, users, and comments.
- Integrate **MongoDB (via Mongoose)** to design and interact with a NoSQL database.
- Implement secure **authentication and authorization** using **JWT** and **bcrypt** for user management.
- Connect the frontend to an **external AI chatbot API** for real-time interactions.
- Practice deploying a **full-stack application** with **Vercel (frontend)**, **Render or Railway (backend)**, and **MongoDB Atlas (database)**.
- Collaborate effectively in a team using **Git and GitHub workflows** (branching, pull requests, code reviews).

## üìã **Technical Requirements**

Your finished website **must explicitly include** the following elements, structured for clarity, responsiveness, and interactivity.

### **1. Header (Navbar)**

- **Frontend:**
  - Create a **responsive navbar** with:
    - Logo
    - Right-side buttons:
      - Login/Signup (when not authenticated).
      - Profile icon (when logged in leads to Dashboard (find dashboard details below on point 6).
      - Light/Dark mode toggle.
- **Backend:**
  - Build a route `GET /api/auth/user` to return user details from the JWT token.
  - Middleware `authMiddleware`: Check if a JWT exists in headers and verify it.
  - **Test:** Ensure the profile dropdown only appears when the JWT is valid.

### **2. User Authentication**

Users should be able to sign up and log in.

- **Frontend:**
  - Create **three separate pages** in React:
    - **Signup Page:** A form for new users to register.
    - **Login Page:** A form for existing users to log in.
    - **Password Reset Page:** A form to request a password reset (basic version).
  - Use React Router to navigate between these pages.
  - Redirect users to the Dashboard after successful signup/login.
  - Success and error messages(popups)
- **Backend:**
  - Create REST routes:
    - `POST /api/auth/signup`: Hash passwords using **bcrypt** and store in MongoDB.
    - `POST /api/auth/login`: Verify user credentials, issue a **JWT token**, and return it.
    - `POST /api/auth/reset-password`: Handle password reset logic (basic version).
  - **Test:**
    - Prevent duplicate users.
    - Return error messages for invalid login attempts.

### **3. Collapsible Sidebar**

The sidebar provides navigation and is toggled via a hamburger icon.

  - Sections inside the sidebar:
    - Dashboard _(only for logged-in users)_
    - All Posts
    - Create Post _(only for logged-in users)_
    - My Posts
  - Use **React Context** to manage sidebar state globally.
- **Backend:**
  - Secure ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy Posts‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCreate Post‚Äù routes with **JWT middleware**.
  - **Test:** Users without a token should be redirected to Login.

### **4. Blog Feed Section**

This is the main content of the homepage where users see all blog posts.

- **Frontend:**
  - Display blog posts cards in a **grid or list view** with pagination.
  - Each blog card should include:
    - Title, summary, image, author name and avatar, date, and like and comment count.
    - A ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù button that links to the Single Blog Post page.
- **Backend:**
  - API:
    - `GET /api/posts?page=1&limit=10`: Fetch posts with pagination.
    - Use MongoDB aggregation to include author details from the `users` collection.
  - **Test:** Query params handling for pagination

| **12. API Integration** (**3 max**)             | **3 points:** External API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) is integrated, **functioning properly**, and uses **secure keys**, error handling, and clean controller logic. Responses are parsed and displayed meaningfully.                         | **2 points:** API is integrated but with limited functionality or no key protection. Error handling is minimal.                                    | **1 point:** Attempted integration but **not functional** or produces errors. No error handling.                        | **0 points:** No API integration attempted.                                                                                                               | N/A                                                                                                                                  | N/A                                                                                                                | N/A                                                 |

### ‚úÖ **Scoring Summary**

- **Maximum points: 44**
- **Pass mark (80%):** 35/44

## üö© **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Forgetting to **secure backend routes** with JWT middleware (e.g., users can access "Create Post" without logging in).
- Not validating forms on the frontend (e.g., allowing empty email/password fields).
- Hardcoding data instead of fetching dynamically from the API.
- Storing JWT tokens insecurely (e.g., in plain `localStorage` without considering XSS).
- Failing to test the app on **mobile and smaller screens** (non-responsive design).
- Missing error handling for API calls (e.g., no user feedback when login fails).
- Forgetting to add `.env` for API keys and exposing sensitive credentials on GitHub.
- Forgetting to update the README file with project instructions and team details.
- Not merging branches properly on GitHub (merge conflicts left unresolved).
