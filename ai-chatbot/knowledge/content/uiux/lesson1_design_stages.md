# **The six design stages**

You land your first design gig. Your team trusts you with the new “user dashboard.” Excitement hits until you open your design tool and stare at that endless, intimidating white canvas.

You wonder:

> Where do I even start?
>
> _Should I draw a button? Build a prototype? Copy what I see on Dribbble?_
>
> You scroll, overthink, procrastinate, panic and repeat.
>
> You’re not alone. Every designer, from rookie to pro, has been paralyzed by the “blank canvas curse.”
>
> **But here’s the good news:** Great design isn’t magic. It’s a processa series of simple, practical steps anyone can follow.

> Let’s demystify the entire journey, so you’ll never get lost again.

## 💡 Topic: What are the 6 stages of design

Design paralysis hits everyone with the fear of starting from scratch, not knowing where to begin. But UI design isn’t magic. Think of it as cooking a meal: gather rough ideas (sketches), build your recipe’s backbone (wireframes), prep key ingredients (components), plan the order of steps (user flows), serve it on a beautiful plate (hi-fi designs), and taste-test it before guests arrive (prototyping).

Each stage is a practical, low-pressure step to move your idea forward. Skipping steps often means wasted work or designs that confuse users. By following the process, you’ll create user-friendly, professional interfaces every time.

**The 6 Stages of UI Design**

Here are roughly, the six major stages of UI design 👇

| Stage        | Goal                     | Output              | Tools              | Watch Out For…                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Sketches     | Fast idea generation     | Rough doodles       | Paper, Whiteboard  | Overthinking, perfectionism      |
| Wireframes   | Layout & structure       | Black/white layouts | Figma, Balsamiq    | Adding color too soon            |
| Components   | Consistency, reusability | UI Kits, states     | Figma, XD, Sketch  | Custom elements, ignoring states |
| User Flows   | Map user journeys        | Diagrams, arrows    | Flowmapp, diagrams | Missing edge/error cases         |
| Hi-Fi Design | Visual polish, branding  | Final screens       | Figma, XD, Sketch  | Skipping earlier steps           |
| Prototype    | Test & validate          | Clickable mockups   | Figma, InVision    | Not testing with real users      |
