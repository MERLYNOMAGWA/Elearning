# **Section Three: Non-Relational Databases with MongoDB**

Imagine you‚Äôre in charge of a growing online bookstore. One day, you get a call from your boss:

> ‚ÄúOur customers want to see their reading lists, wishlists, and reviews‚Äîall in one place. Oh, and by the way, every user‚Äôs wishlist looks totally different: some want books, some want games, some want both. And next week, we might start storing their favorite snacks too. Can our database handle that?‚Äù

You feel the pressure that your old spreadsheet (or even your beginner SQL database) just can‚Äôt keep up with this _wildly flexible_ data.

### **Why Learn This?**

Traditional (relational) databases are like neat, well-organized libraries, great if every book follows the same rules. But in the real world, data is messy and changes constantly!

**MongoDB** is a database that doesn‚Äôt force you to fit everything into strict tables. It lets your data breathe and grow, just like your customers‚Äô wishlists.

## **üí° Topic: MongoDB**

Imagine that you are the architect of a massive castle with hundreds of rooms, each containing valuable treasures. You need a way to organize and keep track of all the items in the castle, so you decide to create a catalog.

Now, imagine that the catalog you created can only sort items by their room number, which means you can only find a specific item by searching through every room in the castle. This process would be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient, especially if you have to search for multiple items at once. This is a problem that can't be solved using the traditional catalog.

Similarly, in full-stack development, traditional relational databases like MySQL have limitations when it comes to handling unstructured data, which can cause issues when working with large amounts of data. This is where non-relational databases come in.

Can you tell the difference between MYSQL and MongoDB?

To put it in our castle analogy, MongoDB is like a modular castle that can easily expand and adapt as needed. You can add more rooms, change the layout, and even add entire floors to accommodate new features and functionalities. With MongoDB, you have the flexibility to build and customize your data structure to fit your specific needs, without having to conform to a rigid table-based schema like in relational databases. So, while you may know how to work with traditional relational databases, you can't efficiently work with unstructured data unless you use non-relational databases like MongoDB. Here is a comparison between relational and non-relational databases üëá

### Relational Databases (SQL)

---

- Data is stored in tables (rows & columns)
- Strict schema: all rows follow the same structure
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
- Best for highly structured, predictable data
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for queries
- Supports complex relationships & JOINs between tables
- Great for transactions and consistency (ACID compliant)
- Scales up (vertical scaling: bigger server)
- Schema changes require migrations and downtime
- Best for banking, accounting, analytics, HR systems
- Slower to adapt to new data requirements

### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

---

- Data is stored in collections of documents (like JSON)
- Flexible schema: each document can be different
- Examples: MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra, DynamoDB
- Best for rapidly changing, messy, or varied data
- Uses various query languages (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries)
- Stores related data together; less emphasis on JOINs
- Great for scalability, flexibility, and speed
- Scales out (horizontal scaling: add more servers)
- Can add new fields at any time with zero downtime
- Best for social apps, catalogs, IoT, user profiles, and content feeds
  Easy to experiment and grow with app changes
