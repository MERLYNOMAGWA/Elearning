**Welcome, apprentice.**

You’ve spent the last few weeks pushing through uncertainty, learning to think, build, and adapt. You’ve written your first lines of code, mapped out your first designs, and interacted with systems that learn. Now, as others have before you, you stand at a point of transition.

**This isn’t more content.** This is the test that reveals what kind of builder you’re becoming.

In the Guild of the Future, talk means nothing without action. You don’t move forward by claiming potential, you move forward by showing it. And here, what you build speaks louder than anything you say.

## 📜 The Task Ahead

You will now create a single project: a fully realized **Startup Profile Website**—a one-page digital identity for a fictional startup **you create yourself**.

This site must communicate your startup’s problem, origin story, vision, and offering using narrative, design, and front-end development.

It must be functional, responsive, and interactive—and feel like it could launch today.

Your journey is divided into **three phases**, each building on the last:

1. **Phase 1: The Weaver’s Test (Discovery & Design Phase)**

   Define your fictional startup. Identify a problem, audience, and solution. Design a prototype of your website in Figma that reflects your brand identity and value proposition.

2. **Phase 2: The Architect’s Test (Build Phase)**

   Turn your design into a live, responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Build it from scratch. Deploy it publicly.

3. **Phase 3: The Synth’s Test (AI Integration Phase)**

   Add a real chatbot using Puter.js or another simple JS framework. Make it answer FAQs about your startup.

Each phase unlocks the next. You must complete all requirements and meet the rubric in order to advance.

> Before you begin each phase:
>
> - Review the **Requirements**, **Objectives**, **How to Start**, and **Rubric**.
> - Use the self-checklist to confirm your submission is complete.
> - Partial credit is not given for unfinished work! **your submission will be judged as it stands.**

---

### 🔔 **Plagiarism/Originality**

**All work submitted must be your own. Using code, designs, or templates you did not create is not allowed and will result in automatic disqualification.** Using AI for error checking is allowed; using it to generate code or design for you is not. **Originality checks are enforced.**

## 🎒 Learning Goals

<aside>
💡

This assessment is your opportunity to demonstrate and deepen the skills you’ve built so far. Each learning goal maps to a phase of your project:

</aside>

**1. Design Thinking** (_Phase 1: The Weaver’s Test_)

- Plan your information architecture (what goes where and why).
- Structure interfaces to guide users naturally.
- Produce a Figma design that clearly reflects your unique story and can be built by a developer.

**2. Front-End Development** (_Phase 2: The Architect’s Test_)

## 🧮 How Your Final Score is Calculated

Your final grade is **weighted** across the three project phases:

| **Phase**                    | **Weight in Final Score** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Phase 1: Design (Figma)**  | 30%                       |
| **Phase 2: Web Development** | 40%                       |
| **Phase 3: AI Chatbot**      | 30%                       |

<aside>
💡

To **pass** and be invited for the oral exam, you need a **total score of 80% or above**.

</aside>

### How the Weighted Score Works

1. **Calculate your percentage for each phase:**
   - Phase 1 Score (%) = (Your Phase 1 Score ÷ Max Phase 1 Score) × 100
   - Phase 2 Score (%) = (Your Phase 2 Score ÷ Max Phase 2 Score) × 100
   - Phase 3 Score (%) = (Your Phase 3 Score ÷ Max Phase 3 Score) × 100
2. **Multiply each phase percentage by its weight:**
   - Weighted Phase 1 = Phase 1 Score (%) × 0.3
   - Weighted Phase 2 = Phase 2 Score (%) × 0.4
   - Weighted Phase 3 = Phase 3 Score (%) × 0.3
3. **Add up all weighted results for your final score:**

   ```mathematica
   Final Score (%) =  [Phase 1 Score (%) × 0.3] + [Phase 2 Score (%) × 0.4] + [Phase 3 Score (%) × 0.3]
   ```

### 📊 Example Calculation

Suppose you get these raw scores:

| Phase | Your Score | Max Score | Weight |
| ----- | ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1     | 32         | 40        | 30%    |
| 2     | 33         | 39        | 40%    |
| 3     | 17         | 20        | 30%    |

**Step 1:** Find the percentages for each phase:

- **Phase 1:** (32 ÷ 40) × 100 = 80%
- **Phase 2:** (33 ÷ 39) × 100 ≈ 84.6%
- **Phase 3:** (17 ÷ 20) × 100 = 85%

**Step 2:** Multiply by weights:

- Phase 1 Weighted: 80% × 0.3 = 24
- Phase 2 Weighted: 84.6% × 0.4 = 33.84
- Phase 3 Weighted: 85% × 0.3 = 25.5

**Step 3:** Add the final score:

- **Final Score = 24 + 33.84 + 25.5 = 83.34%**

**Result:** You pass! (≥ 80%)

### 📝 Grading & Feedback

- After grading, you’ll get a detailed breakdown for each phase and your final score.
- **If you score 80% or above, you’ll be invited to an oral exam.**
- Pass the oral exam to be eligible for placement as a Full Stack Developer, UI/UX Designer, or Generative AI Engineer.

### ❗ Important Notes

- **No partial credit for late submissions.** Late work will not be accepted or graded.
- **Bonus points** are included **before** calculating your final percentage.
- If you **score below 80%**, you will not advance to the oral exam or placement round.

- https://www.art.yale.edu/
- https://thebiguglywebsite.com/

### 🔻 **Common Traits of Bad Websites**

Watch out for these issues when creating your portfolio:

- Generic layout reused from personal portfolios (missing startup identity)
- Weak typography hierarchy (no difference between headings, body, buttons)
- Too much placeholder text or lorem ipsum
- Overuse of cards without purpose or interactivity
- No real structure or spacing everything feels stacked or scattered
- Ignoring mobile users (sections break or overflow)

**🔍 A very short Case Study 1: Why _The Big Ugly Website_ Fails at UX**

[Visit Site](https://thebiguglywebsite.com/) _(if you dare)_

This site is often referenced as a deliberate example of poor design. For UI/UX students, it illustrates what happens when basic design principles are ignored.

1. **Lack of visual hierarchy**

   There's no structure guiding the user’s eye. Headings, content, and interactive elements are randomly placed, overwhelming the user.

2. **Inconsistent typography**

   Multiple font styles and sizes are used arbitrarily, which damages readability and breaks the visual rhythm of the page.

3. **Ineffective color usage**

   Clashing colors are used without purpose, leading to poor contrast and visual fatigue. There's no brand or theme consistency.

4. **Broken elements and low trust**

   Broken links and missing images reduce credibility. Users can't interact confidently with the interface.

5. **No content grouping or flow**

   There’s no user journey. Content isn’t categorized or ordered in a way that helps users achieve any goal.

6. **Missing identity and user focus**

   It’s not clear who the site is for or what it wants to communicate. It lacks purpose, clarity, and user empathy.

</aside>

<aside>

**🔍 A Very Short Case Study 2: Why the _Yale School of Art_ Website Undermines Usability**

[Visit Site](https://www.art.yale.edu/)

Although it represents a top-tier art school, this site falls short on user experience. Here’s what UI/UX students can learn from it.

1. **Crowded and chaotic layout**

   Pages are visually overwhelming. With no spacing or flow, users can’t scan or digest content easily.

2. **Outdated interface and inconsistent UI patterns**

   The design feels patchy. Each section looks different, with inconsistent font treatments and misaligned elements violating basic UX coherence.

3. **Poor accessibility**

   Light text on light backgrounds and small font sizes create major issues for readability. It fails key accessibility standards (contrast, legibility, clarity).

4. **Confusing navigation**

   Menus are hard to locate, and some sections are buried. Users can’t easily find what they need, critical info is not prioritized.

5. **No predictable user flow**

   Pages lack logical structure. Without consistent page layouts or clear calls-to-action, users are left unsure how to interact with the site.

6. **Unclear purpose and lack of targeting**

   The audience isn’t defined. There's no clear entry point for prospective students, staff, or the public, violating user-centered design thinking.

</aside>

**📌TIp:** A site without structure or intention is unusable. Always design with the user journey in mindstructure content, guide attention, and maintain consistency.
