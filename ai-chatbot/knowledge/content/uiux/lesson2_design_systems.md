# **design systems**

Imagine this: You're building a sleek mobile app. At first, it's fun for just a few screens. But as the project grows, chaos starts creeping in. The same button looks slightly different on each page. You're not sure which shade of blue is the real primary. Updating one element means hunting down 20 others. ðŸ˜µ Welcome to design spaghetti.

Now picture this: You make one change to a component, and it's reflected across your entire project. Everything is organized. You collaborate seamlessly with devs. Life is good.

Thatâ€™s the power of a Design System, your projectâ€™s single source of truth, and in this lesson, you will learn how to create design systems to make your life a little bit easier.

## ðŸ’¡ Topic: Design Systems

A **Design System** is like a toolbox for your product's design. It includes all the visual building blockscolors, typography, components, and rules that keep everything consistent and easy to update. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you design a screen, you just pull from this ready-made kit.

In Figma, you can define **Styles** (like colors and text), build **Components** (like buttons), and publish them as a **Library** to reuse across projects. This not only improves design consistency but also makes collaboration with developers much smoother.

Hereâ€™s how these parts work together:

- **Styles** are reusable settings for things like colors and text. If you change a style, it updates everywhere itâ€™s used.
- **Components** are like master copies of UI elements. You can reuse them across files and update them centrally.
- **Libraries** let you share your design system with your whole team. Everyone pulls from the same source of truth.

This approach prevents "design drift," where different pages or teams start to create their inconsistent styles, and makes large-scale updates fast and reliable.
