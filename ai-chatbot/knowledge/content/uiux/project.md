# Design Phase

### üéØ Goal

The goal of this project is to evaluate your ability to create an **accessible**, **component-based**, and **responsive** user interface using UI design tools (Figma), semantic HTML structures, and accessibility best practices. You will design and test a simple blogging platform interface that complies with **WCAG guidelines** and supports users with diverse needs

Students will act as **UI/UX Designers** responsible for creating wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and a well-documented **design system** that includes reusable components, typography, color styles, and iconography. You will use tools like Figma and Google Docs to communicate your design intent. Your deliverables will directly inform developers who will later implement your designs

### üß≠ From Research to Interface

With your empathy work, personas, and user flows complete, it‚Äôs time to bring your design to life. The next section outlines the required UI components you must include in your Figma prototype. Your final design should reflect user insights, demonstrate thoughtful layout choices, and maintain a consistent brand across desktop and mobile.

**Accessibility must be a core priority** in all design decisions, including color contrast, focus indicators, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. Designs should align with **WCAG 2.1** guidelines (AA level minimum).

This design will directly guide the development phase, so it must be completed and shared on time. Any delay or failure to deliver a high-quality, accessible design will hold the Designer accountable for impacting the team‚Äôs overall progress and performance.

  - Build **reusable components** (buttons, form fields, modals, cards, nav, chat UI) with variants and states.
  - Use **autolayout**, **naming conventions**, and **component documentation**.
  - Create a dedicated **‚ÄúDesign System‚Äù page** in your Figma file.
- **Screen & Flow Design:**
  - Organize work into **feature-based Figma pages** (e.g., `Auth Screens`, `Blog Feed`, `Chatbot UI`, `Dashboard`).
  - Design with **accessibility** (WCAG) and **mobile-first** principles in mind.
  - Ensure all components used are pulled from the design system.
- **AI-Enhanced Interfaces:**
  - Collaborate with AI/tech leads to:
    - Visualize CrewAI agent flows (e.g., trend detection UI, AI writing assistant, summarizer feedback)
    - Design chat interactions (typing states, quick replies, status messages)
    - Clarify how AI feedback appears visually (inline, modal, tooltip, etc.)
- **Tickets & Progress:**
  - For each feature or screen, create a **Linear design ticket** with:
    - Clear feature or page title
    - Links to related Figma frames
    - Checklist of subtasks (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign login modal‚Äù, ‚ÄúDocument button states‚Äù)
    - Tags (e.g., `UI`, `UX`, `Design System`, `AI UI`)
  - Update progress as you move through stages:
    - `In Progress` ‚Üí `Review with Dev` ‚Üí `Finalized`

**2. Definition Phase:**

- **Project Goals Document**
  - Define a clear mission that aligns user needs with content engagement and technical constraints.
  - Example: "Design a human-centered blogging platform that empowers users to write, explore, and engage with posts easily, while ensuring accessibility and ease of navigation."
- **User Personas**
  - Create 3-4 detailed personas grounded in your research.
    - Example 1: _James, 22, a student who reads blogs on tech and prefers dark mode and keyboard shortcuts._
    - Example 2: _Aisha, 29, is a casual writer who wants to quickly post and edit her blogs on the go._
    - Example 3: _Musa, 35, a visually impaired reader who relies on screen readers and prefers accessible layouts._

---

**3. Empathy Phase:**

- **User Research Summary**
  - Conduct surveys or interviews focused on:
    - What motivates users to write or read blogs?
    - What challenges do they face using blogging platforms?
    - How important is accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, color contrast)?
  - Summarize insights such as:
    _‚ÄúUsers are more likely to stay if they can customize reading modes and navigate posts efficiently.‚Äù_
- **Empathy Maps**
  - Create at least 2 empathy maps using: _Says, Thinks, Does, Feels_
    - Example:
      - _Says:_ ‚ÄúI hate when the font is too small or light.‚Äù
      - _Thinks:_ ‚ÄúI hope this site remembers my reading preferences.‚Äù
      - _Does:_ Scrolls quickly to look for the latest blogs.
      - _Feels:_ Confused when buttons aren‚Äôt labeled clearly for screen readers.

Includes: alt text for all images/media, full keyboard navigability, contrast ratio checks, logical reading order, and semantic labels (e.g. ARIA roles, landmark regions). Dev handoff includes accessibility notes, e.g. aria-labels, skip links, alt descriptions.                                                                      | **5 Points:** Most WCAG 2.1 AA requirements met. Minor accessibility issues or inconsistent implementation in 1-2 flows or views (e.g. missing alt text or incomplete keyboard path). Most components are accessible, but not fully documented.                      | **4 Points:** Accessibility is addressed in some core views, but gaps exist e.g., inconsistent use of semantic tags, color contrast not checked everywhere, or incomplete screen reader support. Annotations for devs are partial.        | **3 Points:** Some accessibility considerations are present, but not consistent. For example: one view supports keyboard nav, but another doesn't. Alt text or roles are inconsistently applied. Little evidence of testing across devices or assistive tools. | **2 Points:** Attempt made to include accessibility, but major elements are missing or broken. Designs may include alt text or contrast checks in isolated areas, but overall not user-friendly for all. No dev handoff guidance included. | **1 Points:** Accessibility is superficially mentioned or represented with incorrect tags/approaches. Use of color, structure, and navigation shows lack of understanding of inclusive design. No dev-facing instructions. | **0 Points:** No accessibility considerations present. Designs are inaccessible : poor contrast, missing alt text, no semantic labels, no keyboard access, and no attempt at inclusive navigation. |

## üö© **Common Mistakes Designers Should Avoid**

- Skipping meaningful user research and relying on assumptions instead of insights from real users.
- Creating shallow or generic personas and empathy maps that don‚Äôt reflect actual user behavior or accessibility needs.
- Overcomplicating layouts or using excessive decorative elements that reduce usability.
- Designing only for desktop and neglecting responsive behavior across mobile and tablet devices.
- Using inconsistent visual branding, mixing fonts, colors, spacing, or icon styles.
- Failing to meet accessibility standards, e.g., low contrast, missing alt text, lack of keyboard navigation, poor reading order.
- Building unrealistic or disconnected user flows that don‚Äôt align with how users interact with the blog platform.
- Designing a chatbot that feels visually or functionally disconnected from the rest of the site.
- Leaving Figma files cluttered, unstructured, or lacking components and documentation makes handoff difficult.
- Skipping usability testing and iteration, ignoring valuable peer or user feedback.

## ‚úÖ **Designer Self-Check Before Submission**

- [ ] I conducted real user research and documented actionable insights from interviews or surveys.
- [ ] My personas and empathy maps are original, clearly structured, and reflect the real needs of blog readers and writers.
- [ ] My user flows represent realistic tasks like creating a post, exploring trending blogs, commenting, or managing a user profile.
- [ ] I‚Äôve designed mobile-first wireframes for all required screens, then extended to desktop views.
- [ ] My interactive prototype in Figma covers core features, includes hover/tap/focus states, and works smoothly on both mobile and desktop.
- [ ] My visual system, colors, typography, and layout are consistent and support clarity and brand identity.
- [ ] I followed WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines: high color contrast, alt text, keyboard navigability, semantic structure, and focus indicators.
- [ ] I included a clear, styled chatbot section with example prompts and integrated it seamlessly into the app interface.
- [ ] I used reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, navbars, comment boxes) and organized them into a Figma component library.
- [ ] My Figma file is clean and handoff-ready: well-labeled frames, nested components, and clear flow logic.
- [ ] I‚Äôve written and included a UX strategy summary (200-300 words) explaining major design decisions.
- [ ] I tested my prototype with peers or users and made iterations based on feedback.
