Has this happened to you before ?

You’re now in a self-paced, intensive learning environment. That freedom is powerful, but without structure, it can easily turn into stress, distraction, and burnout.

Have you ever…

- Spent hours watching tutorials but couldn’t remember anything?
- Made a detailed study plan but still fell behind mid-week?
- “Studied” for hours only to realize you didn’t actually learn much?

You're not alone.

The truth is, **most people were never taught how to learn effectively on their own**. In school, we were told _what_ to learn, not _how_. So we end up highlighting paragraphs, binge-watching videos, or rewriting notes... but nothing sticks. Now that you're in a BootCamp with real deadlines and high expectations, those old habits won’t cut it. You need a better system.

Here’s the good news: there are scientifically backed methods that help you learn faster, retain more, and feel less overwhelmed. Here’s what we’ll cover 👇

| **Method**             | **Why It Works**                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Recall**      | Forces your brain to retrieve info, making it stick better than just rereading. |
| **Spaced Repetition**  | Strengthens memory by reviewing info at just the right time.                    |
| **Pomodoro Technique** | Breaks your work into focused sprints to prevent burnout and procrastination.   |
| **Time Blocking**      | Creates structure in your day so you don’t waste time figuring out what to do.  |
| **Reflection**         | Helps you track what’s working and stay mindful of your progress.               |

### 🔄 **Practice: Apply What You Just Learned**

**🧠 Your Task**: Use the Pomodoro Technique to Create Flashcards from This Lesson

This will be your first official Pomodoro session in BootCamp, and you’ll use it to build your Anki deck, based on the lesson you just completed.

**🧰** **Tools You’ll Need**

| Tool                   | What it’s for                                                 | Link                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Anki (Desktop App)** | For creating and reviewing flashcards using spaced repetition | [Download Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) |
| **Pomofocus**          | A free web timer for Pomodoro sessions                        | [Use Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)     |

### **📋 Instructions**

1. **Step one: Start a Pomodoro (25 Minutes)**
   - Open [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/)
   - Set it to **25 minutes**
   - Hit **Start**
   - You’ll use this time block to focus _only_ on creating your flashcards.
2. **Step two: I**nstall Anki
   - Go to [apps.ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download the desktop version. (Use the Windows or Mac version depending on your device.)
3. **Step three: C**reate a new deck
   - Call it: `BootCamp Core Concepts`
4. **Step four**: Add at least 5 Flashcards to your study deck; these should be based on the videos you watched earlier.

   Here are a few examples for inspo 😉

   | **Front (Question)**                                        | **Back (Answer)**                                                                                |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | What is active recall and how does it work?                 | A method where you retrieve knowledge from memory rather than re-reading or passively reviewing. |
   | What does spaced repetition help with?                      | Long-term memory retention by revisiting content right before you're likely to forget it.        |
   | What tool uses spaced repetition?                           | Anki                                                                                             |
   | What is the Pomodoro Technique?                             | A time management method that alternates focused 25-minute work sessions with 5-minute breaks.   |
   | What’s one common reason students fall behind in BootCamps? | Using passive study methods and failing to manage their time with intention.                     |

   📌

   You can **customize** the cards based on your takeaways of the videos, just make sure you’re applying **active recall** (write a question you must answer, not just copy-paste notes).

   </aside>

5. **Step five**: Take a screenshot

   Once your deck is ready:

   - Take a screenshot showing your Anki deck or a few flashcards
   - Save it, you’ll upload it for submission

6. **Step six**: Take a five-minute break ⌛

   After your Pomodoro timer rings:

   - Get up, stretch, breathe
   - No screen time during the break!

   This helps your brain consolidate what you just worked on; it’s part of the system, not a bonus.

7. **Step seven:** Reflect on the process 🪞

In a Google Doc, write 2–3 sentences answering:

- What did you focus on during your Pomodoro?
- How did it feel to work this way?
- Do you think you’ll use the Pomodoro Technique again?

1. **Step eight:** Submit your work

   - \*\*\*\*Screenshot your Anki flashcards and add them to the reflection doc you created in Step seven
   - Submit it under the `“self-directed learning and time management`” assignment here 👇
